# TaraKernel – Focus Week Plan (Draft v2)

**Participants:** 2  
**Hard success criterion:** a working MVP is produced  
**Collaboration backbone:** GitHub (issues, discussions, PRs)  
**Invariant:** coding is a primary communication channel  

---

## Global Objectives

- **ObjA** — Merge mental models and surface implicit assumptions
- **ObjB** — Process feedback without destabilizing core invariants
- **ObjC** — Define and *stabilize* an MVP feature surface
- **ObjD** — Implement and validate the MVP end-to-end

---

## Global Working Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Every day has:
  - **1h synchronous meeting**
  - **clear daily goals** (what / why / when)
- **No meeting without GitHub artifacts**
  - at least one issue created, updated, or closed
- **No design discussion without an implementation target**
  - same day or next day
- **Issues are anchors**
  - not necessarily problems
  - not necessarily controversial
- **Discussions close only with verifiable outcomes**
  - code, tests, PRs, summaries, or explicit references
- **Coding is communication**
  - misunderstandings should surface in code, not only in speech

---

## GitHub Workflow (Agreed Early, Used Always)

- **Issues**
  - One issue = one core concept / invariant / question
  - May be:
    - a question
    - a confirmation
    - a link to an existing design note
- **Comments / Discussions**
  - Transient reasoning
  - Exploration
  - Clarification
- **PRs**
  - Decisions embodied in code
  - Strongest form of agreement

---

## Day 1 — Sunday: Alignment + Bootstrap

**Daily Goal:**  
> Establish a shared operational frame *and* start coding immediately.

### 1h Meeting
**Focus:**
- Walk through this plan and adjust if needed
- Agree on GitHub workflow and etiquette
- Start a **draft list of core conceptual nodes**
  - incomplete and noisy is fine
  - purpose: shared map, not perfection
- Clarify:
  - what will be coded *today*
  - why it matters for the MVP
  - expected delivery by end of day

**Mandatory Outputs:**
- Repository setup finalized
- Initial issues created:
  - workflow/meta issue
  - first batch of concept-node issues (draft)
- Clear Day-1 coding targets assigned

### Remote Work
- Begin MVP implementation immediately
- Open issues freely:
  - questions
  - confirmations
  - links to existing notes
- Code used to surface:
  - unclear boundaries
  - naming friction
  - implicit assumptions

---

## Day 2 — Monday: Core Invariants Through Code

**Daily Goal:**  
> Force kernel invariants to become executable constraints.

### 1h Meeting
**Focus:**
- Review what was implemented
- Identify where code forced design clarification
- Update / refine concept-node issues
- Decide:
  - what invariants must already be enforced in MVP
  - what can remain implicit

**Mandatory Outputs:**
- At least one concept-node issue closed or clarified
- New issues spawned by implementation friction
- Concrete coding goals for the day

### Remote Work
- Implement:
  - canonicalization path
  - hashing hooks
  - minimal record identity
- Add minimal tests where invariants are critical

---

## Day 3 — Tuesday: DataFlows & MVP Surface

**Daily Goal:**  
> Make the MVP executable end-to-end, even if minimal.

### 1h Meeting
**Focus:**
- Walk the current ingest → commit → store → read path
- Identify missing links
- Decide MVP exclusions explicitly
- Ensure every major concept-node has at least one issue/discussion

**Mandatory Outputs:**
- MVP feature list (explicit)
- Out-of-scope list (explicit)
- Issues updated with verifiable closure criteria

### Remote Work
- Implement missing DataFlow pieces
- DiskBackend minimal support
- Focus on *working path*, not polish

---

## Day 4 — Wednesday: Integration Sprint (Placeholder)

**Daily Goal:**  
> Reduce the system to something that actually runs.

### 1h Meeting
**Focus:**
- Integration blockers
- Misalignments revealed by real execution
- Decide fast compromises if needed

**Mandatory Outputs:**
- Integration-related issues opened/closed
- Clear targets for unblocking MVP

### Remote Work
- Heavy implementation
- Minimal refactors only if they unblock progress
- Keep discussions in GitHub

---

## Day 5 — Thursday: Stabilization Sprint (Placeholder)

**Daily Goal:**  
> Turn “it runs” into “it is correct enough”.

### 1h Meeting
**Focus:**
- Validate invariants via code/tests
- Close remaining concept-node discussions where possible
- Identify known limitations

**Mandatory Outputs:**
- Issues closed with:
  - tests
  - code references
  - explicit summaries

### Remote Work
- Improve error paths
- Strengthen validation
- Clean obvious technical debt (only if cheap)

---

## Day 6 — Friday: MVP Validation

**Daily Goal:**  
> Confirm MVP success or identify concrete failure.

### 1h Meeting
**Focus:**
- Full end-to-end walkthrough
- Check MVP success criteria
- Ensure both participants can explain:
  - what the kernel guarantees
  - what it explicitly does not

**Mandatory Outputs:**
- MVP acceptance checklist
- Remaining open issues labeled as post-MVP

### Remote Work
- Final fixes
- Documentation touch-ups if needed

---

## Day 7 — Saturday: Retrospective & Next Steps

**Daily Goal:**  
> Consolidate understanding and decide the future trajectory.

### 1h Meeting
**Focus:**
- What assumptions held?
- What broke?
- Is the kernel direction validated?
- What is the next milestone?

**Mandatory Outputs:**
- Written retrospective
- Roadmap issue for next phase

### Remote Work
- Finalize summaries
- Tag MVP state
- Optional: short README on kernel philosophy

---

## End-of-Week Definition of Success

- A working MVP exists
- Core invariants are enforced in code
- Key concepts are anchored by issues
- Both collaborators share a clear, explicit mental model
- Disagreements are documented, not hidden
