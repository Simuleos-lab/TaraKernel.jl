## OUTDATED IDEAS

- `#IGNORE`

- **Store as an active semantic layer** 
  Removed assumptions implying the Store had semantic responsibilities; now it is only a directory helper.

- **Segment metadata as arbitrarily rich structures** 
  Trimmed language suggesting flexible metadata; kernel only preserves structural meta.

- **Implicit support for nested or complex record structures** 
  Removed hints contradicting the strict flat TaraSON model.

- **Any reference to kernel interpreting Scopes or Issues** 
  These belong entirely to the Recorder layer under the updated architecture.

- **Suggestions that DynamicLiteRecord could have additional modes or history** 
  Only a single transformation path is allowed in the current model.
