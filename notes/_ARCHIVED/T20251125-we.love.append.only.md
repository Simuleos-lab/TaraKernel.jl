## APPEND-ONLY CONVENIENCE MODEL  
#RATIONALE
- The new `LiteTapeSegment` model (StaticPrefix + DynamicTail) is designed for efficient append-only workflows.
- Appending a single new `StaticLiteRecord` is always possible without rewriting existing data.
- Committing frequently is cheap: sealing a prefix only requires appending one `CommitRecord`.

---

#CONVENIENCE PROPERTIES

### Cheap Single-Record Appends
- Writers may append a single `StaticLiteRecord` at any time.
- No need to allocate a new segment file.
- No need to rewrite or duplicate earlier content.
- Tail grows as needed; prefixes remain untouched.

### Cheap Single-Record Commits
- A commit is simply:
    - append `CommitRecord` to DynamicTail
    - define new `StaticPrefix`
- Cost is proportional only to:
    - writing the commit record,
    - computing the prefix hash.
- No copying, no file rotation, no repacking required.

### Stable Prefixes, Cheap New Snapshots
- Earlier `StaticPrefix` snapshots remain valid forever.
- New snapshots (commits) cost one extra record.
- Enables frequent checkpoints without storage explosion.

#APPEND-ONLY ADVANTAGES

### No Rewriting
- Entire history of the segment is preserved.
- Writers never modify previous prefixes.
- Readers never encounter half-written data.

### Safe Long-Running Tails
- Writer can keep a DynamicTail open for long periods.
- Small or large increments can be appended on demand.
- Commit boundaries are flexible and cheap to create.

### Efficient Streaming
- Tail can be written incrementally with minimal overhead.
- Commit frequency can be tuned:
    - per record,
    - per batch,
    - per user event,
    - per time interval.

### Backend Freedom
- Disk-based handlers can implement:
    - open file with incremental writes,
    - periodic fsyncs,
    - atomic commit operations.
- Other backends may use:
    - blockstores,
    - RAM buffers,
    - chunked streams.
- Meaning stays identical across all implementations.

#IMPACT ON WORKFLOWS

### Low-latency Recording
- Applications can commit as soon as something happens.
- Suitable for simulation logs, observability traces, interactive tools.

### Event-Driven Recording
- Natural model for recording each event as a standalone unit.
- Commit cost ~ one extra record.

### High-Safety Recording
- Even if committing every record, history remains append-only and recoverable.
- No risk of corrupting earlier committed prefixes.

---

#SUMMARY (CONVENIENCE MODEL)
- Append is always cheap.
- Commit is cheap: one commit record + prefix hash.
- No rewrites, no rollbacks, no file duplication.
- DynamicTail enables continuous writes.
- StaticPrefix snapshots provide stable, immutable views.
- This model unifies high performance with strict correctness.
