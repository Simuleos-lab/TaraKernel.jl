## 4. Tape structure

1. **Segments**

   * Each segment is a standalone `.jsonl` TaraSON file.
   * Segment boundaries have no semantic meaning; they are physical groupings.

2. **Meta segment (segment 0)**

   * Contains tape-level metadata.
   * Must be valid TaraSON.
   * Kernel does not interpret user fields; only structural fields matter.

3. **User data segments (segments 1, 2, …)**

   * Contain sequences of canonical LiteRecords.

4. **Ordering**

   * Segments are ordered by index.
   * Records inside each segment are ordered as they appear.
