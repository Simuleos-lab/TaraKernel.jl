# **The Tara Project**

*A unified framework for capturing, structuring, and exchanging contextual data across tools, domains, and workflows.*

It takes its name from **Taravangian**, a central character from *The Stormlight Archive* who embodies the deepest theme behind this project:
**the relentless pursuit of perfect knowledge**

---

## **Overview**

Modern digital work produces an enormous amount of context: simulation runs, research notes, thought processes, events, metadata, logs, measurements, photos, files, and human observations.
Most of this context is scattered across incompatible formats, tools, and systems, making it difficult to unify, search, correlate, or use for long-term reasoning.

**The Tara Project** proposes a unified way to represent and exchange this contextual information.

At its core, Tara is:

* a **shared protocol** (TaraSON),
* a **collection of independent recorders** (e.g., Simuleos, Obsidian plugins, journaling tools),
* a **storage substrate** compatible with the protocol,
* optional **higher-level services** for querying, indexing, merging, and analysis.

Tara does *not* dictate how tools should operate internally; it only ensures they can speak a **common language of context**.

---

## **Goals**

Tara aims to:

### **1. Create a universal shape for contextual information**

Different tools produce different kinds of records — simulation snapshots, notes, sensor logs, photos, etc.
Tara gives them a **common envelope** so they can interoperate.

### **2. Enable cross-tool reasoning and integration**

A simulation run should be connectable to:

* the note that described it,
* the idea that inspired it,
* the data file that resulted from it,
* the photos or documents associated with the experiment.

A unified protocol makes this possible.

### **3. Preserve data *and* meaning**

Tara treats context as a first-class object, not an afterthought.
Metadata, provenance, labels, hashes, and timestamps are all part of the protocol.

### **4. Remain lightweight, local-first, and tool-agnostic**

Tara:

* does not require servers,
* does not assume cloud storage,
* does not impose a specific database,
* can be used incrementally with any existing workflow.

Tara defines **interchange**, not infrastructure.

---

## **TaraSON: The Unified Context Protocol**

**TaraSON** is the minimal JSON-compatible format used by all Tara recorders.
It defines how contextual records should be structured, what metadata must be present, and how tools can validate or extend the format.

TaraSON is intentionally strict:

* no arbitrary Julia/Python/R objects,
* no ambiguous nesting,
* all values must be deterministic, serializable, and stable across versions.

This discipline ensures that Tara data remains readable, indexable, and durable.

---

## **Recorders**

A **recorder** is any tool that emits TaraSON records.

Examples include:

### **Simuleos**

A recorder for simulation code.
Extracts program state (Scope), transforms it into Context, enforces lite discipline, and emits TaraSON records.

### **Obsidian Collector**

A plugin that turns Markdown notes, headings, blocks, and tags into TaraSON context trees.

### **Journaling & Manual Curation Tools**

Human-authored entries packaged as TaraSON with timestamps, tags, and metadata.

### **Photo & Media Collectors**

Automatic ContextRecords derived from EXIF metadata, geolocation, or image annotations.

### **Sensors / Scripts / Other Software**

Any tool can become a recorder by emitting TaraSON.

## **Storage & Exchange**

Tara deliberately does *not* require a centralized service.
Any of the following can store TaraSON:

* local directories (“tapes”),
* append-only logs,
* Git repositories,
* cloud sync folders,
* databases,
* registries.

The key is that **the records remain valid TaraSON objects** regardless of storage backend.

This makes Tara compatible with:

* local workflows,
* research repositories,
* distributed collaboration,
* personal knowledge bases.

---

## **Higher-Level Ecosystem**

Tara is primarily a **protocol**, but it enables higher-level tooling:

### **Search & Query Engines**

Unified context means cross-modal searches:

* “Show me all notes written before this simulation run.”
* “Link photos taken near the lab on the same day as this experiment.”
* “What ideas influenced this notebook section?”

### **Dashboards & Views**

Any UI can consume TaraSON records and present:

* timelines,
* context graphs,
* experiment histories,
* summaries.

### **Agents & Automation**

LLMs and automated tools can reason over context using the same structure across domains.

---

## **Why Tara?**

Tara provides a simple but powerful answer to a pervasive problem:

> **Context is everywhere, but fragmented.
> Tara makes it interoperable.**

By keeping the protocol small, stable, and tool-agnostic, Tara becomes a minimal foundation on which many tools — scientific, personal, creative, analytical — can build.

It’s not a framework, cloud platform, or service.
It is a **shared language for context**.

---

## **Status**

Tara is an evolving design.
The core pieces being actively defined include:

* TaraSON schema
* rules for “lite” and deterministic serialization
* recorder architecture
* metadata standards
* guidelines for versioning and hashing
* integration contracts for storage systems

Simuleos is the first recorder to be implemented end-to-end.

---

## **Summary**

**The Tara Project** is a universal, protocol-driven way to capture and exchange contextual information across heterogeneous tools, with **TaraSON** as the shared format.

Simuleos is one recorder.
Many others will follow.

Together they form a flexible, local-first ecosystem where context can be collected, correlated, stored, and understood — consistently and across domains.

If you'd like, I can now write:

* the **TaraSON specification**,
* a **vision diagram**,
* or a **scope boundary document** distinguishing Tara vs Simuleos.
