## How to deal with race conditions

- Option 1
- The kernel will assume that race conditions are imposible
- This must be garantied by the calling code

- Option 2
- The kernel will do a best esforce attempt to avoid races
    - using pidfiles
    - runtime locks
- but will not detect/check/nor attempt to correct any consequences of races
- all that on the write/commit/read interface
- no on any runtime manipulation of data
