## Why The Tara Kernel exist like it is?

Take the simplest robust pieces we know work 
— append-only files
- JSONL flat format
- content-addressability
- JSON Pointer–style paths 
— fix them into an kernel
    - stable
    - tiny
- defines how contextual data is recorded everywhere.

That kernel is: 
- small enough to fit in one person’s head
- strong enough to be a long-term anchor for 
    - tooling
    - analysis
    - cross-language interoperability
- That’s a good target.

- Bsically, If we loose all schemas
    - How can I make as easy as possible to reinterpret the meaning of the data
- Unorganize people/systems do not have schemas
- but they have good ideas
- They won't become orginized
- But, we can extract meaning from their records
- Or help them to do it with as small friction as posible
- Orginized people will also want this
- They just will expend less time/energy on the organization phase
- Now we all can have automatic assistances
- TaraSON is just a common substrate
