## How to deal with race conditions?

- Option 1
- The kernel will assume that race conditions are imposible
- This must be garantied by the calling code
- `#THINKING/ABOUT/IT`

- Option 2
- The kernel might do a best esforce attempt to avoid races
    - `#THINKING/ABOUT/IT` `VERY/UNLIKELY`
    - using pidfiles
    - runtime locks
- but will not detect/check/nor attempt to correct any consequences of races
- at least no on the `Storage` level
    - eg. the write/commit/read interface
- Maybe on runtime manipulation of data
- `#THINKING/ABOUT/IT`

- I like more `Option 1`
