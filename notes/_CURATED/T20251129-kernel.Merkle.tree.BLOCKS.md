## TKBC: The kernel block chain (TKBC)
- #IDEA
- The kernel should make illegal overwriting extremely difficult by using a block-chain–like system.
- Each record will contain a content hash.
- Each segment will contain a content hash.
- Each tape will contain a content hash.
- Each tapelib will contain a content hash.

---

## TKBC: Merkle tree
- #IDEA
- We can use a Merkle tree.
- Record content hashes are produced from the actual record content.
    - masking the content hash field itself
- Segment commit hashes are produced only from record content hashes:
    - not from the raw record contents.
    - masking, optionally partially, the commit record itself
- A tape commit hash is created from all segment commit hashes.
- A lib commit hash is created from all tape commit hashes.
