## Kernel Hash Chain: Rationale

- The kernel must make illegal overwriting practically impossible
    - by enforcing a strictly append-only, hash-locked content structure.
- Immutability is achieved through deterministic, content-derived hashes,
  - not through semantic interpretation or transactional logic.
- Each committed record carries exactly one content hash,
  derived from its canonical TaraSON representation.
- Each higher-level object (segment, tape, tapelib) exposes a single authoritative commit hash that binds its ordered content.
- Any attempt to rewrite history necessarily invalidates all dependent hashes, making alteration detectable and prohibitively costly.

***
## Kernel Hash Chain: Implementation

- The kernel composes content identity using a Merkle-style structure.
- Record content hashes are computed directly from canonical TaraSON bytes.
- Segment commit hashes are computed deterministically from the ordered sequence of record content hashes they commit.
- Tape commit hashes are computed from the ordered sequence of segment commit hashes.
- Tapelib commit hashes are computed from the ordered sequence of tape commit hashes.
- All hashes remain transitively grounded in canonical byte representations, preserving a single, unambiguous identity basis.
