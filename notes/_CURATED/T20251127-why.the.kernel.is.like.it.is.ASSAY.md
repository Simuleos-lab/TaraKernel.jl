# Why the Kernel Must Be the Way It Is

## Summary
The kernel is immutable.
The kernel is minimal.
The kernel exists to preserve **raw facts** exactly as they occurred.
TaraSON stays simple so it can serve as a stable foundation for all future meaning extraction.
Higher layers may evolve, but the kernel must remain unchanged.

## Rationale

### Immutability as the foundation of contextual memory
- A recorded event is the real event.
- It is not a cleaned-up version.
- It is not a reinterpretation.
- It is not a summary.
- Mistakes remain part of the record.
- Wrong values remain part of the record.
- Unintended actions remain part of the record.
- These details carry information that may become useful later.
- Future tools will extract meaning from these unchanged facts.
- Rewriting would destroy evidence.
- Destroying evidence harms long-term understanding.
- Audit trails follow the same principle.
- Immutability protects truth across time.

## Changing History Must Be Practically Impossible

- The kernel makes altering past records extremely difficult.  
- Any change forces a complete rehash of the affected segments.  
- Rehashing segments forces rehashing of all dependent tapes.  
- Every link that references those hashes becomes invalid.  
- All those links must be updated everywhere.
- All those links are also data
- So, more rehashing
- The system amplifies the cost of rewriting history on purpose.
- This cost makes historical alteration effectively impossible in practice.
- even if intended

### TaraSON must be simple, stable, and universal
- TaraSON is a flat set of facts/statements.
- It avoids schema decisions.
- It avoids language-specific structures.
- This simplicity makes TaraSON easy to understand.
- This simplicity makes TaraSON easy to verify.
- This simplicity makes TaraSON durable.
- A stable canonical layer allows cross-language compatibility.
- A stable canonical layer survives future tool changes.

### Separation of concerns enables long-term evolution
- The kernel stores facts.
- Higher layers deal with meaning.
- Runtime shapes are conveniences, not truths.
    - eg. arrays, dicts, and objects exist only above the kernel.
- Interpretation may improve over time.
- Extraction tools will evolve.
- Context engines will evolve.
- None of that requires/justify touching the tapes.
- The kernel does not curate narratives.
- The kernel does not rewrite history.
- The kernel only preserves what actually happened.

## Consequences
- The kernel becomes predictable.
- The kernel becomes permanent.
- Future reinterpretations remain safe.
- Future tools can grow freely.
- Tapes act like scientific notebooks.
- Tapes act like audit logs.
- The system gains long-term trustworthiness.
- The canonical layer remains simple and immutable.


## Other words

- For the kernel
- What happened is a concrete event.
- It should not be replaced by a cleaner interpretation.
- It should not be collapsed into a summary of “what we meant”.
- If it contains a mistake, then the mistake is what occurred.
- If it is wrong, that wrongness is the real history.
- If the result is not what you intended, it still is the actual action taken.
- In other words: whatever was recorded is what happened.
- At the kernel level
    - we are not rewriting history or curating narratives; this is not the “Ministry of Truth”.
    - That needs to be implemented at higher level
    - We provide good to all types of costumers

- We’re defining a memory substrate
- Meaning lives higher up

- #GOAL
- asymptotic meaning extraction from past raw signals
