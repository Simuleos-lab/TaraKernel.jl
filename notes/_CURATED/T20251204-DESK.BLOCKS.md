## Terminology: Ingestion and Commit

* #MODEL
* The terms **ingestion** and **commit** name *semantic boundary crossings* in TaraKernel DataFlows.
* They do **not** name concrete implementations, APIs, or storage mechanisms.

### Terminology: Ingestion

* **Ingestion** refers to the transition:
    * `External.Runtime` → `TaraKernel.Runtime`
* Ingestion means:
    * data enters **kernel semantics**,
    * data becomes subject to `tk_*` contracts,
    * data may acquire kernel-level structure,
    * but data is still transient and mutable.
* Ingestion does **not** imply:
    * persistence,
    * canonicalization,
    * validation,
    * identity creation,
    * or durability guarantees.
* Ingestion is the act of bringing data *under kernel authority*, not of making it permanent.

### Terminology: Commit

* **Commit** refers to the semantic transition:
  * `TaraKernel.Runtime` → **storage-grade state**
* Commit means:
  * data becomes **storage-grade** in value and structure,
  * data is now subject to kernel invariants:
    * immutability,
    * canonical representation,
    * content integrity (hashing, commit structure, etc.),
  * data is considered authoritative by the kernel.
* Commit does **not** necessarily mean:
  * that data is already written to a permanent medium,
  * that data is durable across process lifetimes,
  * that data has reached a backend,
  * or that data is yet physically stored.
* Committed data may still be:
  * in memory,
  * in transit,
  * buffered,
  * or never reach a storage backend at all.
* Commit is an **irreversible semantic step**:
  * once committed, data must not be mutated,
  * rollbacks, rewriting, or re-canonicalization are forbidden.
* Commit does **not** specify:
  * which backend is used,
  * how bytes are written,
  * how atomicity is implemented,
  * how or whether persistence occurs,
  * how failures are handled.
* Commit only marks the transition where:
  * content identity becomes fixed,
  * and storage invariants start to apply.

## Ontology: Data: Runtime, Committed, Storage
* **Runtime** data
  * posibly mutable,
  * posibly unsafe,
  * posibly non-canonical,
  * identity not yet fixed.
* **Committed** data
  * immutable,
  * canonical,
  * identity-bearing,
  * authoritative by kernel policy,
  * but, not necessarily durable.
* **Storage** data
  * committed,
  * durable across process lifetimes,
  * persistent by physical medium.
