Context:
- Its purpose is to describe as best as possible an issue.
- An issue is anything, from a moment on a simulation, a registry of an event, or a set of stored data.
- the context do not care on why are you collecting an issue
- It is there for desribing what the issue is.
- for instance, you are developing a model, for each significant iteration of the model dev you make tests
-- Each of this test can produce an issue and a context describing as best as possible what it contains and signify.
--- Like storing used parameters and user explanation notes.
- The main difference is that the Context is forced to be lite
- If all the data you want to store is lite, the issue and the context can be the same.
- But for a general solution we will only force the Context to be lite, the rest can be managed as the user prefer.
-- for instance, you can include in the context a reference to the non lite data blobs
- The context need to be future proof, human readable, like json files
- The context is lite so it can be query fast and effitiently.
