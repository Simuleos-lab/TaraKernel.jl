# **Two dimensions of contextuality**

### **1. Structural dimension (lite discipline)**

A piece of data is eligible to be contextual only if it satisfies the lite rules:

* JSON-compatible  
* shallow  
* deterministic  
* strings / numbers / small vectors / small dicts  
* or other lite blobs  

This ensures universal interpretability (TaraSON compatibility).

### **2. Intentional dimension (semantic role)**

A piece of data is contextual **if it helps answer questions about the Issue**.

It doesn’t matter whether it came from:

* simulation outputs  
* measurement results  
* parameters  
* metadata  
* environment state  
* human annotations  
* logging  

**If it is necessary to explain, understand, or reconstruct the meaning of the Issue, it is contextual.**

# **So contextual data might include:**

### ✔ **Traditional metadata**

(e.g., timestamp, parameters, version)

### ✔ **Descriptive annotations**

(human notes, labels, tags)

### ✔ **Provenance**

(who/what/when/why)

### ✔ **Derived summaries**

(e.g., mean temperature, number of iterations)

### ✔ **AND lite primary data themselves**

(e.g., a small vector of simulation results, a lite matrix, a tiny summary plot encoded as lite structure)

> **If the simulation results are lite, they are *data* but also automatically *contextual* because they serve the explanation of the Issue.**

---

# **Why this matters**

In the Tara philosophy:

### **Context = all lite data that helps meaning.**

Not just metadata.

This removes the artificial distinction between “data” and “context”.  
It aligns with the view that context is an **interpretation layer**, not a category of data.

Some data is inherently explanatory, even if it is also “primary”.

# **Example: Lite primary data as context**

Suppose a simulation produces:

```json
{
  "avg_energy": 1.234,
  "trajectory": [0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2]
}
