# Git Integration

- #NOTE
- Git is not required by the Tara Project, but it is extremely useful for workflows built on top of TaraKernel.jl.
- Many users already rely on Git as their primary tool for versioning, collaboration, and code-centric context.
- The principle *“Do not change how the user already works”* applies:
    - Git remains a natural companion for ContextRecorders such as Simuleos.
    - Git metadata can enrich contextual capture without affecting Tara storage formats.

- #NOTE
- Git provides a stable addressing mechanism for any committed document:
    - `/repo_root/commit/path/to/file:line:column`
- This addressing can be used by ContextRecorders to:
    - reference portions of source code,
    - relate simulation events to specific commits,
    - attach contextual meaning to code evolution.
- It is acceptable for a recorder to ignore uncommitted working-tree changes.
- Git history can supplement TaraSON records with additional provenance when desired.

- #NOTE
- Git can be scanned by a ContextRecorder to produce TaraSON records describing:
    - commits,
    - file snapshots,
    - note evolution,
    - code landmarks.
- Such extraction is recorder-level logic and does not modify the TaraKernel or the Tape model.

- #NOTE
- These ideas are more relevant to recorders interfacing with text-based workflows (e.g., Simuleos, note collectors).
- The core Tara substrate remains unchanged; Git integration is an optional, external interpretation layer.
