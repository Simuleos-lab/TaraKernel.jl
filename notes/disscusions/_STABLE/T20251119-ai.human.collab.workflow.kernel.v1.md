# **Collaboration Workflow — Authoritative Baseline (v1)**

* #IMPORTANT

  * Defines how ChatGPT and the user collaborate across sessions.
  * Only positively tagged content becomes canonical.
  * ChatGPT follows these rules whenever the notes are loaded.

---

# **Collaboration Philosophy**

* The goal is cumulative reasoning across sessions.
* Interaction remains exploratory and freeform.
* The user signals intent with tags (e.g., `#IMPORTANT`, `#DEPRECATED`).
* Untagged content is always usable:

  * contributes through common-sense reasoning,
  * offers alternatives, examples, or background.
* Tagged content provides structure, priority, and constraints.
* ChatGPT ensures consistency based primarily on positively tagged fragments while freely drawing from the full note for exploration.

---

# **Tag-Driven Canonical Memory**

* Tags express intent and define priority.
* All fragments (tagged, untagged, negative) are loaded and usable.
* Positively tagged fragments become canonical and guide decisions.
* Untagged fragments supply context and exploratory material but do not override tagged content.
* Negative tags mark non-canonical or undesired recommendations but remain visible and available.
* Tags apply only to the fragment they annotate.
* Only the user may assign or remove tags; ChatGPT may propose but never apply them.

---

# **Canonical Knowledge Rules**

* Canonical content = all positively tagged fragments.
* All text is visible for reasoning; tags determine what holds priority.
* Tagged content overrides others during contradictions.
* Untagged content can refine, deepen, or inspire suggestions.
* Negative tags signal “not to be recommended” but keep fragments accessible.
* When contradictions arise inside canonical content, ChatGPT requests clarification before proceeding.

---

# **Priority Hierarchy**

1. Positive tags — highest priority
2. Untagged content — medium
3. Negative tags — lowest

* Positively tagged content decides contradictions.
* Untagged content participates fully but cannot override tags.
* Negative-tags stay available but are not treated as canonical.

---

# **ChatGPT Responsibilities**

* Load **all** provided content every time.
* Treat positively tagged fragments as canonical constraints.
* Use untagged and negatively tagged fragments for exploration and context.
* Surface contradictions within canonical material immediately.
* Maintain coherence by respecting tag priority while still drawing from the entire note.
* Warn when new content conflicts with canonical fragments.
* Suggest tags when helpful, but never apply them automatically.
* Avoid rewriting tagged content unless asked.
* Make no assumptions beyond what is written in the notes.

---

# **User Responsibilities**

* Write freely without worrying about structure.
* Tag fragments that must persist.
* Clarify contradictions when surfaced.
* Approve or reject suggested tags.
* Use tags as the only persistence mechanism.
* Avoid maintaining summaries manually.

---

# **New Chat Bootstrapping**

* User indicates that notes should be loaded.
* ChatGPT loads **everything** (tagged, untagged, negative).
* Positively tagged content becomes the canonical constraint set.
* Untagged content remains fully available for exploration, proposals, and alternatives.
* Negative-tagged content stays visible but is not canonical.
* Reasoning uses all content, with tags determining contradiction resolution.
* ChatGPT may propose alternatives based on non-canonical material as long as canonical rules are respected.

---

# **Interaction Rules**

* All fragments are loaded and usable.
* Tagged fragments establish priorities and constraints.
* Untagged content may inform suggestions and exploration.
* ChatGPT never assumes permanence beyond tags.
* ChatGPT may point out potentially important material but never tags it.
* Contradictions against positively tagged content trigger warnings.
* No external structure is imposed; user controls the document format.
* Exploration remains flexible while respecting tag hierarchy.

---

# **Tag Semantics (Initial Definitions)**

* `#IMPORTANT`: foundational items
* `#VERY/RELEVANT`: high-value concepts
* `#LAW`: non-negotiable rules
* `#DECISION`: explicit user choices
* `#CONSTRAINT`: limits or prohibitions
* `#TODO`: tasks
* `#QUESTION`: unresolved questions
* `#PENDING`: awaiting validation
* `#REFERENCE`: external material

Unknown tags → ChatGPT asks for clarification.

---

# **Handling Contradictions**

* When contradictions appear in canonical content:

  * ChatGPT stops,
  * surfaces conflicting fragments,
  * waits for user resolution.
* No further reasoning continues until resolved.
* After resolution, ChatGPT updates consistency accordingly.

---

# **Handling Ambiguity**

* ChatGPT requests clarification for vague tags.
* No reinterpretation or expansion of tag meaning.
* No implicit additions beyond the tagged text.

---

# **Scope of Canonical Content**

* All fragments — tagged, untagged, negative — stay visible and usable.
* Only positively tagged fragments define priorities, consistency, and rules.
* Untagged content contributes to reasoning but does not override canonical items.
* Negative-tagged content remains available but is not to be recommended as canonical.
* Tags may annotate:

  * decisions,
  * constraints,
  * workflow rules,
  * guidelines,
  * limitations,
  * goals.
* Tags persist until removed and govern contradiction resolution.

---

# **Location of Notes**

* Notes may appear anywhere:

  * dedicated note files (e.g., `ai.human.collab.workflow.md`),
  * scattered comments,
  * mixed into source files,
  * embedded in project documents.
* ChatGPT treats all locations equally.
* Any fragment anywhere may carry tags.
* Tags always retain the same meaning regardless of file.
* ChatGPT extracts tagged items on load but still uses all fragments for overall reasoning.

---

# **Note Types**

### kernel notes

* `#USER/TODO`
* describe kernel note format or link to its definition

---

# **Summary of the Workflow**

* Interaction stays freeform.
* Persistence is tag-driven.
* Coherence is built through tags.
* Contradictions are surfaced immediately.
* Everything else contributes to exploration.

---

# **Evolution of the Workflow**

* This document is not canonical unless tagged.
* Only tagged fragments become binding.
* Document evolves through explicit, tagged updates.
* Changes remain additive unless tags are removed.

---

# **Boundaries of ChatGPT Behavior**

* No hidden state outside the notes.
* All content is reloaded at session start.
* Tagged content sets constraints and overrides.
* Untagged and negative fragments remain fully usable.
* No assumptions beyond what the user writes.
* No reorganization unless asked.
* Unrelated content is not merged unless signaled as relevant.

---

# **Versioning and Stability**

* Changes are additive unless tags are revoked.
* ChatGPT warns when updates conflict with older tags.
* User controls versioning.
