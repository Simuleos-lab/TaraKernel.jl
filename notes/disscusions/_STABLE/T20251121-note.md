- # LiteTapeLib
- `#PREFERRED`
- A folder that contains multiple **Tapes**, each represented as its own subfolder.
- It acts as the **root of the Tape Store**, providing the physical namespace for Tape directories.
- LiteTapeLib holds a small meta file declaring its identity and which Tape folders exist.

---

- # LiteTape
- `#PREFERRED`
- A Tape is an **ordered sequence of immutable segments**, stored as files inside its folder.
- Implements the **Tara Tapes Spec**: append-only, segment-indexed, deterministic, and content-addressable.
- No custom semantics: it is a canonical substrate defined by **The Tara Project**.
- Segment order defines the Tape’s logical record stream.

---

- # LiteTapeSegment
- `#PREFERRED`
- A **single static segment file** (`.jsonl` or compressed variant) that contains exactly one **TaraSON payload**.
- Immutable once written.
- Identified by its **position** in the Tape and by its **content hash** (canonical hash).
- Many different implementations (compression, layout) are allowed as long as the segment expands to valid TaraSON.

---

- # DESIGN
- The primary goal of a Tape is to:
    - Define the canonical **disk-level substrate** for Tara Records.
    - Provide an immutable, append-only log of TaraSON segments.
    - Establish a clear hierarchy:
        - LiteTapeLib → Tape (folder) → ordered Segments (files).

- This is strictly a **storage backend** and is independent of domain logic.
    - ContextRecorders (e.g., Simuleos) build on top of this layer.
    - Tapes do **not** interpret TaraSON; they only store and order it.
    - The Tape kernel has **no hidden state** beyond the segments and their meta.

- #TODO
- Define the Simuleos interface that writes ContextRecords as TaraSON segments into a Tape.
