# **AskMyself — Revised Draft**

### Purpose

The *SelfQuestioner* is an app (or a set of interoperable apps) that delivers questions to the user and stores all interactions in an "output" **Tara Tape**.
Its role is **not** to generate questions. Instead, questions are supplied by **external applications**, typically by appending them to another "input" Tara Tape.

---

### Usage Scenarios

The SelfQuestioner can be embedded into common workflows, for example:

* a VS Code extension
* an Obsidian extension

External tools configure which questions to send.

---

### Serving Model

The app cycles through questions using an **infinite repetition pattern**:

* Questions are served **according to priority**.
* Priority modifies the **interval** at which a question reappears.
* No question is allowed an infinite interval (optional rule).
* Serving questions repeatedly allows the system to collect **multiple answers** and observe how they evolve over time.

---

### Context-Aware Delivery

Questions may also be delivered **contextually**, using a mechanism analogous to:

* targeted serving (similar to how Google Ads selects content)

This allows the SelfQuestioner to choose questions based on the current environment or ContextRecord data.

Additionally, questions may originate from multiple **Tara Repositories**.
