# **GENERAL GOAL**

* Describe the layered architecture relating The Tara Project, TaraKernel.jl, ContextRecorders, and Simuleos.
* Enumerate all relevant and explicit ideas without adding unstated assumptions.
* Provide a compact, human-readable and LLM-readable representation.
* Capture relationships, roles, and boundaries between layers.

---

# **THE TARA PROJECT**

* Defines a family of specs and philosophies for context collecting, storage, and sharing.
* Includes TaraSON as the unified context language for Records, links, and system metadata.
* Includes Tara Kernel Spec defining abstract Records, links, scopes, and Tapes as ordered record streams.
* Includes Tara Tapes Spec defining the canonical on-disk representation for Tapes.
* Treats Tapes as part of the official specification rather than a single implementation detail.
* Organizes all tooling and implementations under a coherent conceptual framework.
* Enables multiple tools and languages to interoperate via TaraSON and Tara Tapes.

---

# **TARAKERNEL.JL**

* A Julia reference implementation of the Tara Project specifications.
* Contains `LiteRecords`, implementing Tara Kernel abstract Records in Julia.
* Contains `LiteTapes`, implementing the Tara Tapes Spec in Julia.
* Encodes and decodes system and user Records using TaraSON.
* Implements TapeLibs, Tape directories, segment files, and reserved system segments.
* Provides APIs for reading, writing, repacking, and recovering Tapes.
* Does not define new semantics beyond the Tara Project specs.
* Serves as the foundational substrate for tools and applications in Julia.

---

# **CONTEXTRECORDERS**

* Tools that generate Tara Records based on domain-specific workflows.
* Use TaraSON as the encoding for all produced contextual information.
* Use Tara Tapes as the canonical storage layer.
* Must depend on TaraKernel.jl (or other Tara implementations) to remain spec-compliant.
* May provide additional domain logic not present in the Tara Project.
* Can include tools such as simulation loggers, note-taking integrations, or metadata collectors.
* Produce Records that can be consumed, merged, or shared across the Tara ecosystem.
* Represent the bridge between external domains and the Tara data substrate.

---

# **SIMULEOS**

* A ContextRecorder specialized for scientific simulations.
* Depends directly on TaraKernel.jl and uses its `LiteRecords` and `LiteTapes`.
* Does not implement its own storage format; uses Tara Tapes for canonical persistence.
* Adds workflow logic for scientific code, simulation runs, and contextual capture.
* Operates in Tara-related and Tara-unrelated dimensions simultaneously.
* Provides tooling beyond what the Tara Project defines but remains fully compatible with it.
* Generates Records consumable by any other Tara-compliant system.
* Sits at the application layer while relying entirely on TaraKernel.jl for data semantics.

---

# **CONNECTIONS**

* Tara Project defines the specifications that TaraKernel.jl implements.
* TaraKernel.jl provides the substrate that all ContextRecorders use.
* ContextRecorders depend on TaraKernel.jl for storage and encoding.
* Simuleos is an instance of a ContextRecorder focused on simulations.
* Tara Tapes and TaraSON unify all layers via a common, canonical representation.
