# **TaraSON — The Tara Simple Object Notation**

TaraSON takes its name from **Taravangian**, a central character from *The Stormlight Archive* who embodies the deepest theme behind this project:
**the relentless pursuit of perfect knowledge**

## **The Origin Story**

In Brandon Sanderson’s universe, **Taravangian** is a king who—desperate to save humanity—visits a deity-like spren who grants boons and curses.
He asks for *the capacity to solve the world’s problems*.
The answer is... complicated.

Instead of constant genius, the deity other half, **Cultivation**, intervenes and gives him something far stranger:

### **A mind that swings between brilliance and near-madness.**

Some days, he wakes up with:

* razor-sharp intellect,
* perfect clarity,
* the ability to see patterns everywhere,
* and a drive to record everything into an enormous predictive model called **The Diagram**.

And on other days:

* he is compassionate but confused,
* incapable of deep reasoning,
* barely able to understand the very notes he left for himself.

The Diagram becomes his life’s work—a system that ingests every scrap of knowledge he can collect, from political events to overheard rumors, weather, scribbles, observations, and scraps of prophecy.
**A unification of all information**, regardless of its source or form.

All recorded. All structured. All connected.
A world saved through context.

## **The SON part**

**TaraSON uses a human-readable JSON-like notation as its core: a simple, predictable, and interoperable structure for representing any piece of information—data, metadata, observations, annotations, or context.** It is intentionally minimal, embracing the clarity and ubiquity of JSON while extending it just enough to express provenance, relationships, and meaning. The goal is not to invent a complex new format but to provide a disciplined, universal container that every tool—and every future version of yourself—can reliably parse and understand.
