# Note.Taking.Protocol — DRAFT (self-describing)

---
## Notes are not documents
- #LAW
- A note is *not* a document.
- A file is just a container.
    - Its name has no implicit meaning
- The real unit of meaning is the **section**.
- Files may change.
- Sections persist.

---
## Sections are the primary unit

- #LAW
- Every section expresses exactly **one idea**.
- If an idea grows:
    - split it
    - do not enlarge it
- If two ideas collapse:
    - merge them
- Sections should be:
    - movable
    - copyable
    - reattachable
    - self-contained

---
## A section must stand alone
- #LAW
- Each section must reasonable make sense **without the file it lives in**.
- Minimaly, reader should understand:
    - what problem it touches
    - what claim it makes
    - what uncertainty exists
- But
    - it is expected to use context from other sections.
    - near sections do not mean they must be related
    - the sections are related by tags or explicit meaning

---
## Files are temporary groupings
- #LAW
- A file is only a:
    - staging area
    - thematic bundle
    - working surface
- Files do **not** confer authority.
- Authority lives in tags.

---
## Tags define semantics
- #LAW
- Sections are interpreted exclusively by their **tags**.
- Tags define:
    - maturity
    - stability
    - authority
    - intention
- Documents do not.

---
## Canonical tag set (initial)
- #DECISION
- Every section should *optionally* carry one of:
    - `#LAW` → invariant, must hold
    - `#DECISION` → current commitment taken
    - `#MODEL` → conceptual structure
    - `#INSIGHT` → reasoning or explanation
    - `#ASSUMPTION` → likely but unproven
    - `#QUESTION` → unresolved
    - `#EXPERIMENT` → being tested
    - `#TODO` → task, not idea
    - `#DEPRECATED` → obsolete
- Tags may evolve.
- Meanings must not drift silently.

---
## A section may carry multiple tags
- #DECISION
- Tags are orthogonal.
- A section may be:
    - `#MODEL` and `#EXPERIMENT`
    - `#INSIGHT` and `#QUESTION`
    - `#DECISION` and `#LAW`
- Tags compose meaning.

---
## Maturity is expressed by tag evolution
- #MODEL
- Ideas evolve through states:
```
#EXPERIMENT -> #MODEL -> #DECISION -> #LAW
```
- Nothing becomes a LAW by accident.
- Only deliberate promotion.

---
## Duplication is allowed
- #LAW
- Redundancy is not waste.
- Duplication:
    - preserves thought trajectories
    - enables reinterpretation
    - supports partial understanding
- Repetition is acceptable.
- Inconsistency is not — and must be surfaced.

---
## Contradictions are surfaced, not hidden
- #LAW
- Conflicts must never be silently ignored.
- When two sections conflict:
    - notify inmidiatly
        - but, avoid spamming
- It is recommended that
    - both remain
    - both are visible
    - resolution is explicit
- Truth emerges by clarification, not suppression.

---
## Sections evolve, not erase
- #LAW
- When an idea changes:
    - do not edit history away
    - annotate evolution instead
- Use:
    - `#DEPRECATED`
    - superseding sections
    - explicit references
- History is data.

---
## Notes must support rearrangement
- #LAW
- The system must permit:
    - copy-pasting sections
    - splitting sections
    - regrouping them to different files
        - remamber, files are just containers
    - extracting views from tags
- Structure must not be fragile.

---
## Organization is emergent
- #MODEL
- Folders and filenames are *economic* choices, not semantic ones.
- Organization:
    - follows work rhythm
    - not ontology
- Structure arises after stabilization, not before.
    - We often learn what is stable, we do not always define it

---
## Formal documents are projections

- #MODEL
- Specs, essays, architectures are:
- > *compiled views of atomic sections*

- They:
    - are assembled later
    - are derivative
    - are never the source of truth
- The source of truth is atomic.

---

- ## Authority hierarchy
- #MODEL
- Explicit authority derived from a priority suffix
    - `#TAG1/0` >> `#TAG2/1`
    - independently of the tag meaning
    - This is a method for the user to control
- Implicit authority derived from this order
    - `#LAW`
    - `#DECISION`
    - `#MODEL`
    - `#INSIGHT`
    - `#ASSUMPTION`
    - `#EXPERIMENT`
    - `#QUESTION`
    - `#TODO`
    - `#DEPRECATED`
    - Lower never overrides higher.
- Explicit is law
- Implicit is more a recomendation
- Anyway, all conflicts must be resolve by user intervention

---
## Notes support long-term thought
- #INSIGHT
- This system is optimized for:
    - slow convergence
    - idea recycling
    - reinterpretation
    - memory
- Not for:
    - publication
    - formality
    - aesthetics
    - perfection

---
## Cleanliness follows stability
- #INSIGHT
- Do not clean early.
- Stability precedes order.
- Order follows confidence.

---
## Naming is tentative

- #ASSUMPTION
- Names are hypotheses.
- Rename freely.
- Identity is defined by meaning, not label.
    - Althoug it is a good usage case for tags

---
## One section = one responsibility
- #LAW
- Never let one section:
    - prove a model
    - describe a workflow
    - assert a law
    - ask a question
- all that at the same time.
- Split aggressively.

---
## Systems may be inconsistent during growth
- #LAW
- Temporary incoherence is allowed.
- Silent incoherence is not.
- Tag uncertainty explicitly.

---
## The protocol describes itself

- #MODEL
- This document obeys itself.
- If it violates its own laws:
    - that violation is itself a data point
    - and must be annotated

---
## The protocol must evolve

- #LAW
- No protocol is final.
    - This one mutates.
    - This one adapts.
    - This one learns.

---
## Using the protocol matters more than formalizing it
- #DECISION
- It is better to:
    - use it loosely
    - evolve it daily
    - misuse it occasionally
- than to freeze it prematurely.

---
## Final rule: write first, structure later
- #LAW
- Expression precedes organization.
- Always.
