## The kernel block chain: Rationale

- The kernel should make very difficult any illegal overwriting by creating a block chain system
- Each record will containg a content hash
- Each segment will containg a content hash
- Each tape will containg a content hash
- Each tapelib will containg a content hash

---
## The kernel block chain: Implementation

- We can use Merkle tree
- record content hash are produces from the actuall content hashes
- but, segment commit hashes will be produced only form the record content hashes
    - no the actual content themself
- A tape commit hash will be created from all segments commit hashes
- A lib commit hash will be created from all tapes commit hashes
