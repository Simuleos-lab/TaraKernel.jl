## JIT-style compaction

- Great, but what about the cases in which many Issues share most of their contextual data… for example, identical parameters except for one or two fields?
- What is a simple approach for that?

- One option is to use **Tape/Segment-level optimization**:
    - The Tape first grows in a raw, append-only form.
    - After reaching some threshold, a **repack** pass can be executed.
    - Repacking will create a new equivalent Tape/Segment:
        - eliminate duplicated ContextRecords,
        - merge compatible segments,
        - rewrite segment boundaries for better locality,

- This mirrors the idea of “incremental compiling”:
    - At first, the Tape behaves like a naïve, unoptimized log.
    - Later, a maintenance step reprocesses the existing segments into a more compact, deduplicated, and efficiently readable form.
