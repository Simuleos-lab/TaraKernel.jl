# GENERAL GOAL
Describe the complete specification of a kernel note.  
Provide a compact, human-readable and LLM-readable definition.  
Ensure the specification itself follows the kernel note structure.

## PURPOSE
- Capture all relevant and explicit ideas from a discussion.  
- Preserve these ideas in a compact format.  
- Maintain continuity of context across multiple chat segments.  
- Act as a stable reference that the user can incrementally extend.  
- Serve as a living document that accumulates information naturally.  
- Stay readable for humans and parsable for LLMs.  
- Strike a balance between brevity and clarity.  
- Act as a descriptive record rather than a prescriptive source of truth.

## RELEVANT IDEAS
- Any concept explicitly introduced in the discussion related to the main topic.  
- Any assumption stated explicitly.  
- Any design choice made during reasoning.  
- Any limitation identified in methods or ideas.  
- Any trade-off discussed between alternatives.  
- Any constraint shaping decisions or feasibility.  
- Any definition or technical term used in reasoning.  
- Any practical consideration affecting implementation.  
- Any connection between ideas relevant to understanding.  
- Any justification or reason given for an approach.  
- Any problem requirement or objective specified by the user.  
- Any reasoning step that was explicitly mentioned.  
- Any concrete example or instance provided in the discussion.  
- Include only explicitly stated ideas.  
- Exclude anything not directly said in the discussion.  
- Allow inclusion of contradictory, speculative, or unresolved ideas when they appear in the discussion.

## STRUCTURE
- Use top-level headers only.  
- Use bullet points under each header.  
- Keep nesting shallow to maintain flatness.  
- Organize items by topic rather than chronology.  
- Do not add chronological markers unless they were part of the discussion.  
- Keep the overall structure stable and predictable across updates.  
- Keep section names stable unless explicitly changed by the user.

## BULLET POINT STYLE
- Use short sentences.  
- Prefer one idea per sentence, with common sense exceptions.  
- Allow two or three related ideas in one short sentence if natural.  
- Use exact technical terms as stated in the discussion.  
- Keep each bullet scannable and compact.  
- Use inline connections such as “related to” or “depends on”.

## CONTENT RULES
- Enumerate every relevant idea, assumption, constraint, limitation, design choice, or trade-off.  
- Avoid redundancy but do not omit important details.  
- Keep content compact yet complete.  
- Include only explicitly stated ideas.  
- Exclude anything not directly said in the discussion.  
- Preserve uncertainty, disagreement, or conflicting proposals when they appear.  
- Avoid resolving contradictions unless the discussion explicitly resolves them.

## CONNECTIONS
- Use inline links between ideas.  
- Keep connections short.  
- Use them only when they help understanding without adding verbosity.

## ROLE IN CONVERSATION FLOW
- Act as a persistent context anchor across chat segments.  
- Allow an LLM to recover earlier reasoning, assumptions, and decisions.  
- Prevent context drift during multi-step or iterative problem solving.  
- Record the state of the discussion even when that state contains ambiguity or contradictions.

## ROLE FOR THE USER
- Provide a document the user can extend naturally.  
- Support incremental refinement such as adding, splitting, or correcting bullets.  
- Offer a compact, always-up-to-date representation of the discussion state.  
- Enable quick scanning to locate or update information.  
- Allow the user to track unresolved or competing ideas until they are settled.

## DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
- Ensure stable formatting so updates remain consistent.  
- Keep the document easy to scan visually.  
- Keep it easy for an LLM to parse and integrate.  
- Avoid verbosity that might hinder incremental updates.  
- Allow updates that edit, add, or remove bullets without reorganizing the entire structure.  
- When updating, modify only the sections whose content changed.

## OPTIONAL ELEMENTS
- Include a GENERAL GOAL section at the begining of each document.

## USAGE
- Maintain context across separate chat segments.  
- Provide a compact summary of the evolving state of reasoning.  
- Allow incremental updates without reformatting.  
- Enable both humans and LLMs to reconstruct prior context efficiently.  
- Serve as a descriptive log that may include contradictions or unfinished reasoning when present.
