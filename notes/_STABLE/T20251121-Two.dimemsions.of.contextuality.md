# **Two dimensions of contextuality**

### **1. Structural dimension (lite discipline)**

A piece of data is eligible to be contextual only if it satisfies the lite rules:

* JSON-compatible
* shallow
* deterministic
* strings / numbers / small vectors / small dicts
* or other lite blobs

This ensures universal interpretability (TaraSON compatibility).

### **2. Intentional dimension (semantic role)**

A piece of data is contextual **if it helps answer questions about the Issue**.

It doesn’t matter whether it came from:

* simulation outputs
* measurement results
* parameters
* metadata
* environment state
* human annotations
* logging

**If it is necessary to explain, understand, or reconstruct the meaning of the Issue, it is contextual.**

# **So contextual data might include:**

### ✔ **Traditional metadata**

(e.g., timestamp, parameters, version)

### ✔ **Descriptive annotations**

(human notes, labels, tags)

### ✔ **Provenance**

(who/what/when/why)

### ✔ **Derived summaries**

(e.g., mean temperature, number of iterations)

### ✔ **AND lite primary data themselves**

(e.g., a small vector of simulation results, a lite matrix, a tiny summary plot encoded as lite structure)

This is the part your correction emphasizes:

> **If the simulation results are lite, they are *data* but also automatically *contextual* because they serve the explanation of the Issue.**

Exactly.

# **Why this matters**

In the Tara philosophy:

### **Context = all lite data that helps meaning.**

Not just metadata.

This removes the artificial distinction between “data” and “context”.
It aligns with your earlier notes that context is a **stance** or **interpretation layer**, not a raw type.

Some data is inherently explanatory, even if it is also “primary”.

# **Example: Lite primary data as context**

Suppose a simulation produces:

```json
{
  "avg_energy": 1.234,
  "trajectory": [0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2]
}
```

This is technically **results** — but if they are lite, they *also* become **contextual data**, because:

* They allow quick inspection
* They describe what happened
* They help answer queries
* They are small and reproducible

A Tara record for the Issue would then include both:

* parameters
* metadata
* and these lite results

all within the same ContextRecord.

# **What contextual data is (final refined definition)**

> **Contextual data is any lite, serializable data — whether metadata or primary results — whose role is to describe, characterize, or make intelligible an Issue so it can be understood, identified, queried, or reasoned about.**

Contextual data is defined by its **purpose** and **lightness**, not by category boundaries.

# **Side-by-side clarification**

| Kind of Data                          | Can it be contextual? | Why                     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Metadata (time, params, code version) | ✔ Always              | Descriptive             |
| Human notes                           | ✔ Always              | Interpretive            |
| Provenance                            | ✔ Always              | Identifying             |
| Lite simulation results               | ✔ Yes                 | They describe the Issue |
| Lite derived summaries                | ✔ Yes                 | Meaning-bearing         |
| Heavy binary results                  | ❌ No                  | Not lite                |
| Huge arrays                           | ❌ No                  | Not lite                |
| Arbitrary Julia objects               | ❌ No                  | Not portable            |

This matches both the TaraSON spec and SimuleOs’s philosophy.

# **Short slogan version**

> **Contextual data = all light, meaningful data.
> If it explains the Issue, it belongs in the ContextRecord.**
