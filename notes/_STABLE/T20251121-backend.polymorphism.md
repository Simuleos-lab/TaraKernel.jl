## backend polymorphism

- pluggable architecture  
    - synonym of backend polymorphism  
    - refers only to how a ContextRecorder chooses *where* segments live, not *what* a segment is

---

## Storage Backends

- The Tara Project defines a **single canonical Tape model**.
- All backends must store and retrieve **Tara Tapes** without altering their semantics.
- Backends implement only:
    - how Tape folders are placed,
    - how segments (TaraSON payloads) are stored as files or objects,
    - how reads and writes are dispatched.
- Simuleos may offer a default backend (e.g., a basic filesystem TapeLib).
- Users may select or implement alternative storage backends as long as they:
    - preserve Tape directory structure,
    - preserve segment ordering,
    - preserve TaraSON validity,
    - preserve immutability of segments.

## Segment Loaders

- The Tape format is unique and canonical, but loaders may vary internally.
- Different loaders may optimize for:
    - minimal RAM usage,
    - minimal I/O calls with caching,
    - faster cold-load time,
    - thread safety.
- Loader differences must not alter:
    - the ordering of segments,
    - the TaraSON payloads,
    - the Tape’s logical structure.
- Loader choice is a runtime implementation detail; tapes remain identical.

## TaraLocDescriptor

- A pure-data descriptor used by a Recorder to refer to a Tape, a segment, or storage location.
- Contains only factual fields such as:
    - tape identity,
    - segment index,
    - backend identifier,
    - optional auxiliary fields (format, compression flags).
- No behavior or executable logic.
- String forms may be allowed as sugar (e.g., `"tara://backend/tape/segment"`), but must resolve to the same descriptor structure.
