* Existing objects:
    * Representation = Meaning + Matter  
        * (unchanged; still a useful conceptual lens)

    * Record:
        * A whole data point.
        * May include lite contextual data and references to non-lite data (Artifacts).
        * Its **lite component** is what formally becomes a ContextRecord.
        * Heavy data is never embedded; only linked.

    * ContextRecord
        * The **lite**, TaraSON-compatible projection of a Record.
        * Fully serializable, deterministic, and human-readable.
        * Contains the contextual meaning necessary to **identify, interpret, or describe** a, preferably, of a single Issue.
        * Multiple ContextRecords can describe the same Issue
        * There is no limitation on the number of ContextRecords describing an Issue.

    * Artifact
        * The non-lite part of a Record.
        * Stored externally (files, arrays, binaries).
        * ContextRecords contain only **lite references** to Artifacts, never the bytes.

* **Context**
    * Context is not a separate storage layer; it is the **lite subset** of the data describing an Issue.
    * Context includes anything that helps interpret or identify the Issue.

    * Defined structurally:
        * Only TaraSON-allowed types (as will be formally specified in the Tara Specs).
        * Deterministic, portable, and small.
        * Lite primary results (e.g., outputs of a computation) **are** contextual by structure.
            * They contribute context such as:
                * “this simulation yielded result `x`”.
        * In principle, **all** data produced by an Issue contributes context.
        * Only the lite portion is stored directly in the ContextRecord, **for convenience** and interoperability.

    * Defined intentionally:
        * Some data exists *solely* to provide context.
            * Examples: `issued.date`, `source.commit.hash`, `user.note`, etc.
        * These fields are explicitly authored to strengthen the interpretation of the Issue.

    * Context is extracted from the full Record and becomes a **ContextRecord**.
    * Known properties:
        * Must be lite, small, and stable.
        * Must be sufficient to reconstruct the meaning, not the heavy data.
        * Forces explicitness: all interpretive meaning must be written out, and be lite.
        * Is created intentionally; the system or user decides what meaning is worth preserving.
        * May be produced *a priori* or *a posteriori* relative to the Issue creation.
    * Context is durable:
        * If heavy data is lost or corrupted, the ContextRecord still explains what existed.
        * It is future-proof and tool-agnostic.
    * Context is the basis of interoperability:
        * All Recorders (including Simuleos) emit ContextRecords in the same TaraSON format.
    * Context supports efficient querying:
        * Because it is small and structured, it is the natural index for the larger ecosystem.
    * Context bridges semantics and storage:
        * It transforms events, states, or moments into searchable, interpretable units.

---

* **Issue**
    * Context always describes an Issue.
    * An Issue is a discrete event, state, or action selected for contextualization.
    * An Issue can be described by **many** ContextRecords, often the expected scenario.
    * The inverse is **not** recommended, a single ContextRecord describing multiple Issues.
    * An Issue is created at the moment a Recorder decides to capture one.

---

* **Context discipline**
    * Only lite, TaraSON-compatible fields may appear inside a ContextRecord.
    * All non-lite values must be:
        * removed,
        * reduced to lite summaries,
        * or turned into references to external Artifacts.
    * Violations result in errors at the Recorder layer.

---

* **ContextRecord Properties**
    * Immutable once created.
    * Self-contained (contains all lite meaning needed to interpret an Issue).
    * Deterministic: same content ⇒ same canonical serialization ⇒ same hash.
    * Portable: any Tara-compliant tool can read it.
    * Queryable and indexable.
    * Acts as the atomic semantic unit in Tara Tapes.

---

* **Context & Meaning**
    * Creating a ContextRecord is an act of meaning-making.
    * It captures the user’s or system’s **interpretation** of the Issue.
    * Context extraction formalizes awareness, as the system describes what happened and why it matters.
    * Explicit context enables reproducibility and lineage.
    * A collection of ContextRecords forms a semantic map of a workflow or dataset.

---

* **Design Implications**
    * Context must remain small, structural, and readable.
    * Ideally, a ContextRecord should be small enough that a human can easily inspect and reason about it.
    * Heavy data must always be referenced, never embedded directly.
    * The ContextRecord must remain flat and strictly TaraSON-valid.
    * Context is produced by ContextRecorders.
        * The Kernel may insert minimal system metadata when required for builtin validations or structural guarantees.
    * Context should accumulate naturally over time — each new question or perspective may justify producing an additional ContextRecord.
