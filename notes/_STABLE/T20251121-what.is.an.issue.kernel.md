# **WHAT IS AN ISSUE — KERNEL NOTE**

## GENERAL GOAL

* Define the concept of an **Issue** within the Tara ecosystem.

---

## PURPOSE

* Establish the semantic unit that contextual data describes.
* Clarify what triggers the creation of a ContextRecord.
* Create a precise definition for interoperability across recorders.
* Distinguish Issues from ContextRecords, raw data, and events.
* Provide clear boundaries and examples for developers.

---

## DEFINITION

* An **Issue** is the entity, event, state, action, computation, or artifact **being described** by contextual data. `#LIKED`
* It is the **subject** of a ContextRecord. `#LIKED`
* It is defined by its **recording moment**: an Issue exists when a recorder decides to document it. `#LIKED`
* It is **discrete**: an Issue represents one occurrence, not a continuous process. `#LIKED`
* It is **meaningful**: an Issue must matter enough to warrant description, but no global significance is required. `#LIKED`
* It is **tool-agnostic**: any recorder can define Issues as long as they emit TaraSON ContextRecords. `#LIKED`
* Idealy, one Record should describe a single Issue. `#LIKED`


---

## PROPERTIES

* An Issue is the **referent** of all contextual data associated with it.
* An Issue may contain both metadata and lite primary data.
* Issues are **independent of their context representation**; the ContextRecord is a description, not the Issue itself.
* Issues form the **semantic atoms** of Tara’s universal context graph.
* Issues are **referentially stable**: once recorded, they remain addressable through their ContextRecord.
* An Issue can represent:

  * a simulation run or iteration,
  * a measurement or sample,
  * a thought, note, or annotation,
  * a file creation moment,
  * a human action,
  * an external event detected by a recorder.

---

## ROLE IN THE SYSTEM

* Issues anchor **ContextRecords**.
* Issues define what a recorder is observing.
* Issues make contextual data **queryable and comparable**.
* Issues allow construction of **lineage, causality, and provenance chains**.
* Issues provide **semantic granularity**: each is a unit of meaning.
* Issues unify heterogeneous domains (simulation, journaling, photos, notes, sensors) under a common conceptual model.

---

## DISTINCTION FROM OTHER CONCEPTS

* An Issue is **not** a ContextRecord; the latter is the record describing the Issue.
* An Issue is **not** the raw heavy data; it is the event or object for which that data may have been produced.
* An Issue is **not** the computation itself; it is the instance of computation you choose to describe.
* An Issue is **not** a storage object; it is the semantic target of a storage object.

---

## RELATION TO CONTEXTUAL DATA

* Contextual data is created **for** an Issue.
* Anything lite that helps answer questions about an Issue qualifies as contextual data.
* Lite primary data may also be contextual data if it describes the Issue.
* The boundary between “data” and “context” is intentional, not structural.

---

## CREATION AND LIFECYCLE

* An Issue is created implicitly when a recorder captures context.
* In SimuleOs, this corresponds to `@sim_scope`, which marks a moment that becomes an Issue.
* In other recorders, the Issue may come from:

  * note creation,
  * photo capture,
  * sensor event,
  * manual user input,
  * file system triggers.
* Once recorded, an Issue becomes a node in Tara’s unified context space.

---

## EXAMPLES

* A simulation step recorded through `@sim_scope "iter-23"`.
* A paragraph in an Obsidian note.
* A laboratory measurement taken at time *t*.
* A photo with EXIF metadata.
* A user writing “idea about model stability”.
* A script finishing a computation and emitting a TaraSON snapshot.
* A sensor detecting a temperature exceeding a threshold.

---

## NON-EXAMPLES

* A continuous process with no discrete capture point.
* Raw binary simulation results without any contextual description.
* Internal runtime states not chosen for recording.
* Arbitrary data dumps that violate lite discipline.
* A ContextRecord itself (description ≠ Issue).

---

## CONNECTIONS

* Issue ↔ ContextRecord (describes)
* Issue ↔ Recorder (created by)
* Issue ↔ TaraSON (represented through)
* Issue ↔ Provenance graph (node)
* Issue ↔ Lite constraints (eligible for contextual description)
* Issue ↔ Query engines (search target)

If you'd like, I can next produce:

* a **kernel note for “ContextRecord”**,
* a **kernel note for “Contextual Data”**,
* or a **diagram linking Issue → ContextRecord → TaraSON → Tape**.
